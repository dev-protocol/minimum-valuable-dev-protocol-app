          <h2>What is Dev Protocol?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Stakes.social is an application based on the Dev Protocol.</p>
            <p>
              The Dev Protocol is a middleware protocol built on Ethereum that allows you to{' '}
              <Text mark>tokenize various activities</Text> by using the Dev Protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              <Text mark>Staking</Text> DEV on tokenized activity will enable activity owners to mine DEV, and those who
              stake them earn staking reward as an interest.
            </p>
          </div>
        </Section>

          <h2>What is tokenization?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              <Text mark>Tokenization</Text> in the Dev Protocol means authenticating an activity and issuing its own
              ERC20-token, called <Text mark>Property</Text>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Property is an ERC20-token that conforms to the Ethereum standard, so its ownership can be divided
              into small pieces and shared by many people.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>What is staking?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              <Text mark>Staking</Text> in the Dev Protocol means depositing and locking up on{' '}
              <Text mark>Properties</Text>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Staking against a Property means that you support the ability of that Property to mine. (This works like a
              DPoS.)
            </p>
            <p>The staker can earn a portion of the DEV that the Property has mined during the staking period.</p>

          <h2>What are the rewards?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              <Text mark>Rewards</Text> in the Dev Protocol means for Property shareholders DEV earned on the outcome of
              the activity, and for stakers, the DEV received as interest.
            </p>

        <Section>
          <h2>What is mining?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              <Text mark>Mining</Text> in the Dev Protocol means measuring the outcome of the activity associated with a
              Property and issuing new DEV based on the results.
            </p>
            <p>
              The total number of DEV is unlimited. But the higher the amount locked up by the Dev Protocol, the fewer
              new issued DEV there will be, and eventually zero.

            <p>
              These algorithms are determined by the contract called Policy and can be updated by the will of the
              people.
